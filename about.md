Hi there! IÂ´m Oluwaseun Opanuga. 
I'm a very passionate software developer and I enjoy architecting and creating solutions. I'm very big on quality and a strong advocate for clean and well written software that works. 
I write software professionally and as a hubby. You would normally catch me in front of my computer banging out code or researching the next big thing in software development. My
Pet projects have helped a lot in this regard. The software development life cycle is a good friend of mine and I love to see solutions come to fruition. I'm an avid learner and I 
also love to share knowledge hence this blog.

### More Information

personal opinion.
