Hi there! IÂ´m Oluwaseun Opanuga. 
I'm a very passionate software developer and I enjoy architecting and creating solutions. I'm very big on quality and a strong advocate for clean and well written software. I write software 
for fun and professionally. You would normally catch me in front of my computer banging out code or checking the internals of some open-source codebase. The software development life cycle is 
a good friend as I love to see solutions come to fruition. I'm an avid learner and I also love to share knowledge hence this blog.
